# coding-challenge
*Coding-challenge are little problems that you have to resolve with code, some problems are asked by top technologies company's like Google, Facebook, Uber..*

## Getting started:
Run this command to install dependencies.

```
npm install
```

## Langages used:
* NodeJs.

## How it works ? 
### Structure:
All the challenges lived in the `challenges` folder, they all start with `<challenge-name>` in each folders there are JavaScript file where you can find the code associated.

### Resolved a challenge:
You can use anything that you want except function's who directly resolved a challenge.
* Example: For the C1 challenge you can't use the `sort()` method directly.

**To get details on a challenge check the README file inside the challenge folder to get a full description.**

### How to passed a challenge ?
the only way for your code to be success is to passed the test, those test are defined in the `test` folder where you will find subfolder who corresponds to a challenge.

We're using third party libraries (AVA) to write our tests.

### Run a test:
To run a test

* JS - Use the `npm run <challenge-name>`.

The test rules are defined in the `test` folder, normaly you don't have to modify any files in this folder but if you're curious you can look inside.

> **Note** - This command will watch your `.js` file every time you save your file it will re run the test process for you no need to launch this everytime.
