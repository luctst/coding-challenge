# coding-challenge
*Coding-challenge are little problems that you have to resolve with code, some problems are asked by top technologies company's like Google, Facebook, Uber..*

## How it works ? 
Three folder:
* C++, where you will find the challenge written in C++.
* js, for JavaScript.
* ruby, for Ruby.

In each folder you will find files with the name of the challenge that they solved.
> **Note** - To get more details on a challenge check the first comment section of a file to get a full descriptive of the challenge.

## How to passed a challenge ?
To pass a problem you must passed three tests with diferents data we're using Jest for testing code with Javascript the other languages are not defined for now.

The test rules are defined in the `test` folder where you will find subfolder who correspond to a programming language with files who match the challenge they solved.
> **Note** - To get details on the test read the descriptive comment present on each challenges files.
