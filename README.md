# coding-challenge
*Coding-challenge are little problems that you have to resolve with code, some problems are asked by top technologies company's like Google, Facebook, Uber..*

## Getting started:
Run
```
npm install
```
to install all NodeJs dependencies.

## Langages used:
* NodeJs.
* Ruby.
* C++.

## How it works ? 
### Structure:
All the challenges lived in the `challenges` folder, they all start with `C<number><challenge-name>` in each folders there are `.js, .rb, .c` files where you can find the code associated.

### Resolved a challenge:
You can use anything that you want except function's who directly resolved a challenge.
* Example: For the C1 challenge you can't use the `sort` method directly.

**To get details on a challenge check the first comment section of a file to get a full description of the challenge.**

### How to passed a challenge ?
the only way for your code to be success is to passed the tests, those tests are defined in the `test` folder where you will find subfolder who corresponds to a challenge.

We're using third party libraries to write our tests:
* JS - Jest.
* Ruby - Rspec.
* C++ - To defined.

### Run a test:
There are differents ways to run your test in terms of your langages:

* JS - Use the `npm run C<number>`.
* Ruby - To defined.
* C++ - To defined.

The test rules are defined in the `test` folder, normaly you don't have to modify any files in this folder but if you're curious you look inside.
> **Note** - To get details tests read the descriptive comment present on each challenges files.

## Contributing:
You'll like to solve the challenge ? it will be a pleasure for us :)

1. Fork the repo.
2. Create a branch with your GitHub name and the challenge you're trying to solved, Ex: `luctst/C2`.
3. Follow the project structure.
4. Run the tests.
5. Create a PR with the template we gave by giving a maximum information's.

See your code alive :)

## Challenge:
